# Analyze-naive-and-pregnant-females-responses
analyzing AOB neurons responses for chemo-sensory stimuli in naive and mated females

The main function is "analyze_bruce_urine_responses". The goal of this function is to perform various analysis  (single session correlation, population response, pairwise comparison, three way comparison) to data collected from AOB neurons from pregnant and naive females. 
Different parameters determine which response to include in the analysis may be defined.
In addition, the function "plot_units_for_manual_selection" allows manual classification of the response grade and response time by visualizing raster plots and PSTH of each unit. 

The code is written in MATLAB
